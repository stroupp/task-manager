# Task Manager

## Overview

Task Manager is a web application that allows users to manage their personal or work-related tasks. Built with React and TypeScript, it integrates with a JSONPlaceholder API to simulate a backend service.

## Features

- **Task Listing**: View all tasks registered in the system.
- **Task Addition**: Add new tasks to the list.
- **Task Editing**: Update the details of existing tasks.
- **Task Deletion**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Task Prioritization**: Assign priorities to tasks.
- **Filtering**: Filter tasks by priority or category.

## Installation

To get started with the Task Manager, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-manager.git
cd task-manager
npm install
```

## Installation

Here is the main page of the app:

Here you can see there is a priority and category tag for each task. There was no filtering info in the json so I added it randomly right after I fetched the list.
In the edit part, user can edit the category and priority of any task. User can filter with text, priority and category tags(from the dropdown menu).

User can edit the info of each card by clicking to the edit button.
